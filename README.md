## General Description of the Dataset 🌳

🏭 The Air Quality dataset  consists of statistical data from an air quality monitoring station located at road level in a unique area in Italy. Sensors at this station measured hourly average values ​​of common gases such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), and benzene (C₆H₆). An official analyzer (reference device) was also tested alongside these sensors, ensuring comparable measurements.
## Variables (Columns)

The dataset contains 15 variables. Some of these variables are:

 ⚫ Date and Time: Date and time of measurement. 

 ⚫CO(GT), NMHC(GT), C₆H₆(GT), NOx(GT), NO₂(GT): Pollutant gas values ​​measured by the official analyzer (actual reference data).

 ⚫PT08.S1(CO), PT08.S2(NMHC), PT08.S3(NOx), PT08.S4(NO2), PT08.S5(O3): Response values ​​obtained from different MOX sensors (these sensors are sensitive to specific gases).
 
 ⚫T, RH, AH: Temperature (°C), relative humidity (%) and absolute humidity (g/m³).

## Analysis Uses

This dataset is typically used in a variety of applications, such as:

🔵 Regression analysis (e.g., predicting CO or NO₂ levels),

🔵 Time series analysis (assessing changes in air quality).
