# IST349 - Statistical Modelling Techniques HW-3
## General Description of the Dataset 
In this assignment, we are asked to proceed with a data set ready for analysis or by using the data set we made ready for analysis in the 2nd assignment.I want to proceed with a new data set because the other data was more related to time series and in some cases, methods such as filling the data with the median etc. are applied instead of deleting the data, so I prefer a data set without missing or duplicate observations, since I do not prefer to apply this.
