# IST349 - Statistical Modelling Techniques HW-3
In this assignment, we are asked to proceed with a data set ready for analysis or by using the data set we made ready for analysis in the 2nd assignment.I want to proceed with a new data set because the other data was more related to time series and in some cases, methods such as filling the data with the median etc. are applied instead of deleting the data, so I prefer a data set without missing or duplicate observations, since I do not prefer to apply this.Also, I will first lay the foundation with the mtcars data embedded in r and then establish the regression model with another complex data.

## General Description of the Dataset 

The Abalone dataset aims to predict the age of abalones, a type of marine mollusk, from their physical measurements. The age is estimated by counting the number of rings on the shell and adding 1.5 years. The dataset contains 4,177 observations and nine variables, including eight input attributes and one target variable (Rings). The attributes are: Sex (categorical: M, F, I—infant), Length, Diameter, Height, Whole weight, Shucked weight, Viscera weight, and Shell weight, all measured in millimeters or grams. The Rings variable represents the number of shell growth rings and serves as a proxy for age. The dataset has no missing values and is often used for regression tasks, though it can also support classification problems by grouping abalones into age categories. Common analyses include building predictive models such as linear regression, random forest, or neural networks to estimate age, and exploring differences in physical characteristics across sexes.
