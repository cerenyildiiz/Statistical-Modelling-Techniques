# IST349 - Statistical Modelling Techniques HW-3
In this assignment, we are asked to proceed with a data set ready for analysis or by using the data set we made ready for analysis in the 2nd assignment.I want to proceed with a new data set because the other data was more related to time series and in some cases, methods such as filling the data with the median etc. are applied instead of deleting the data, so I prefer a data set without missing or duplicate observations, since I do not prefer to apply this.Also, I will first lay the foundation with the mtcars data embedded in r and then establish the regression model with another complex data.

## General Description of the Dataset 
The Abalone dataset aims to predict the age of abalones, a species of marine mollusk, from their physical and morphological measurements. Since the actual age of an abalone cannot be determined directly without cutting the shell and counting the growth rings under a microscope—a destructive and labor-intensive process—the number of rings is used as a proxy variable. To approximate the biological age more realistically, researchers apply the formula Age = Rings + 1.5, where the additional 1.5 years represent the estimated time between birth and the formation of the first ring.
⚪ Age = Rings+ 1.5
